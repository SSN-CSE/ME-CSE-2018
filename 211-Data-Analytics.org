** Course Objectives
- To implement Map Reduce programs for processing big data
- To realize storage of big data using Hbase, MongoDB
- To analyse big data using linear models
- To analyse big data using machine learning techniques for classification and clustering

** Suggestive Experiments
*** Hadoop 
1. Applications using Map Reduce programming ( Examples : word count / frequency programs / matrix multiplication)
2. Implement an MR program that processes a dataset

*** R
3. Linear and logistic Regression (Loan prediction using Credit approval dataset, Sales prediction using Bigmart dataset)
4. Implement SVM / Decision tree classification techniques (Flower type classification based on available attributes using Iris dataset, Passengers survival classification using titanic dataset)
5. Implement multilayer perceptron (Hand written digit classification using neural network)
6. Implement clustering techniques (Document categorization by multiclass techniques)
7. Visualize data using any plotting framework

*** Database
8. Application that stores data in Hbase / MongoDB (Sentiment analysis using twitter dataset)
