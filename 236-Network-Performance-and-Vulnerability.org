** Course Outcomes
Upon the completion of the course the students should be able to: 
- Identify the different traffic in telecommunication networks.
- Analyze the traffic and performance of the network.
- Construct the vulnerability life cycle using available standards and models. 
- Identify the agents and perform active and passive scanning and to diagnose the vulnerabilities and their impacts using various testing methods. 
- Point out how vulnerabilities are analyzed in various network protocols.
